Fine tuning of GPT-3.5 Turbo

## Fine Tuning:

Fine-tuning refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model (a model trained on a large dataset) and adapting it to a new, but related, task. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be time-consuming and require a lot of data, fine-tuning leverages the knowledge captured in the pre-trained model to achieve better performance on the new task with potentially less data.

**Use cases:**

1. Setting the style, tone, format, or other qualitative aspects.
2. Improving reliability at producing a desired output.
3. Correcting failures to follow complex prompts.
4. Handling many edge cases in specific ways.
5. Performing a new skill or task thatâ€™s hard to articulate in a prompt.
