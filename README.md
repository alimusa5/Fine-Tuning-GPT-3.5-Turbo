Fine tuning of GPT-3.5 Turbo

##**Fine Tuning:**

Fine-tuning refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model (a model trained on a large dataset) and adapting it to a new, but related, task. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be time-consuming and require a lot of data, fine-tuning leverages the knowledge captured in the pre-trained model to achieve better performance on the new task with potentially less data.

**Use cases:**

Setting the style, tone, format, or other qualitative aspects
Improving reliability at producing a desired output
Correcting failures to follow complex prompts
Handling many edge cases in specific ways
Performing a new skill or task thatâ€™s hard to articulate in a prompt
