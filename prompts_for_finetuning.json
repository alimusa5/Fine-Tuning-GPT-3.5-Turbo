I\u2019ll make myself a memory, I have only to listen, the voice will tell me everything, tell it to me again, everything I need, in dribs and drabs, breathless, it\u2019s like a confession, a last confession, you think it\u2019s finished, then it starts off again, there were so many sins, the memory is so bad, the words don\u2019t come, the words fail, the breath fails, no, it\u2019s something else, it\u2019s an indictment, a dying voice accusing, accusing me, you must accuse someone, a culprit is indispensable, it speaks of my sins, it speaks of my head, it says it\u2019s mine, it says that I repent, that I want to be punished, better than I am, that I want to go, give myself up, a victim is essential, I have only to listen, it will show me my hiding-place, what it\u2019s like, where the door is, if there\u2019s a door, and whereabouts I am in it, and what lies between us, how the land lies, what kind of country, whether it\u2019s sea, or whether it\u2019s mountain, and the way to take, so that I may go, make my escape, give myself up, come to the place where the axe falls, without further ceremony, on all who come from here, I\u2019m not the first, I won\u2019t be the first, it will best me in the end, it has bested better than me, it will tell me what to do, in order to rise, move, act like a body endowed with despair, that\u2019s how I reason, that\u2019s how I hear myself reasoning, all lies, it\u2019s not me they\u2019re calling, not me they\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s not yet my turn, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t stir, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel a body on me, I\u2019m not suffering enough yet, it\u2019s not yet my turn, not suffering enough to be able to stir, to have a body, complete with head, to be able to understand, to have eyes to light the way, I merely hear, without understanding, without being able to profit by it, by what I hear, to do what, to rise and go and be done with hearing, I don\u2019t hear everything, that must be it, the important things escape me, it\u2019s not my turn, the topographical and anatomical information in particular is lost on me, no, I hear everything, what difference does it make, the moment it\u2019s not my turn, my turn to understand, my turn to live, my turn of the lifescrew, it calls that living, the space of the way from here to the door, it\u2019s all there, in what I hear, somewhere, if all has been said, all this long time, all must have been said, but it\u2019s not my turn to know what, to know what I am, where I am, and what I should do to stop being it, to stop being there, that\u2019s coherent, so as to be another, no, the same, I don\u2019t know, depart into life, travel the road, find the door, find the axe, perhaps it\u2019s a cord, for the neck, for the throat, for the cords, or fingers, I\u2019ll have eyes, I\u2019ll see fingers, it will be the silence, perhaps it\u2019s a drop, find the door, open the door, drop, into the silence, it won\u2019t be I, I\u2019ll stay here, or there, more likely there, it will never be I, that\u2019s all I know, it\u2019s all been done already, said and said again, the departure, the body that rises, the way, in colour, the arrival, the door that opens, closes again, it was never I, I\u2019ve never stirred, I\u2019ve listened, I must have spoken, why deny it, why not admit it, after all, I deny nothing, I admit nothing, I say what I hear, I hear what I say, I don\u2019t know, one or the other, or both, that makes three possibilities, pick your fancy, all these stories about travelers, these stories about paralytics, all are mine, I must be extremely old, or it\u2019s memory playing tricks, if only I knew if I\u2019ve lived, if I live, if I\u2019ll live,

forget that, I resume, you must resume, never stirred from here, never stopped telling stories, to myself, hardly hearing them, hearing something else, listening for something else, wondering now and then where I got them from, was I in the land of the living, were they in mine, and where, where do I store them, in my head, I don\u2019t feel a head on me, and what do I tell them with, with my mouth, same remark, and what do I hear them with, and so on, the old rigmarole, it can\u2019t be I, or it\u2019s because I pay no heed, it\u2019s such an old habit, I do it without heeding, or as if I were somewhere else, there I am far again, there I am the absentee again, it\u2019s his turn again now, he who neither speaks nor listens, who has neither body nor soul, it\u2019s something else he has, he must have something, he must be somewhere, he is made of silence, there\u2019s a pretty analysis, he\u2019s in the silence, he\u2019s the one to be sought, the one to be, the one to be spoken of, the one to speak, but he can\u2019t speak, then I could stop, I\u2019d be he, I\u2019d be the silence, I\u2019d be back in the silence, we\u2019d be reunited, his story the story to be told, but he has no story, he hasn\u2019t been in story, it\u2019s not certain, he\u2019s in his own story, unimaginable, unspeakable, that doesn\u2019t matter, the attempt must be made, in the old stories incomprehensibly mine, to find his, it must be there somewhere, it must have been mine, before being his, I\u2019ll recognize it, in the end I\u2019ll recognize it, the story of the silence that he never left, that I should never have left, that I may never find again, that I may find again, then it will be he, it will be I, it will be the place, the silence, the end, the beginning, the beginning again, how can I say it, that\u2019s all words, they\u2019re all I have, and not many of them, the words fail, the voice fails, so be it, I know that well, it will be the silence, full of murmurs, distant cries, the usual silence, spent listening, spent waiting, waiting for the voice, the cries abate, like all cries, that is to say they stop, the murmurs cease, they give up, the voice begins again, it begins trying again, quick now before there is none left, no voice left, nothing left but the core of murmurs, distant cries, quick now and try again, with the words that remain, try what, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve forgotten, it doesn\u2019t matter, I never knew, to have them carry me into my story, the words that remain, my old story, which I\u2019ve forgotten, far from here, through the noise, through the door, into the silence, that must be it, it\u2019s too late, perhaps it\u2019s too late, perhaps they have, how would I know, in the silence you don\u2019t know, perhaps it\u2019s the door, perhaps I\u2019m at the door, that would surprise me, perhaps it\u2019s I, perhaps somewhere or other it was I, I can depart, all this time I\u2019ve journeyed without knowing it, it\u2019s I now at the door, what door, what\u2019s a door doing here, it\u2019s the last words, the true last, or it\u2019s the murmurs, the murmurs are coming, I know that well, no, not even that, you talk of murmurs, distant cries, as long as you can talk, you talk of them before and you talk of them after, more lies, it will be the silence, the one that doesn\u2019t last, spent listening, spent waiting, for it to be broken, for the voice to break it, perhaps there\u2019s no other, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not worth having, that\u2019s all I know, it\u2019s not I, that\u2019s all I know, it\u2019s not mine, it\u2019s the only one I ever had, that\u2019s a lie, I must have had the other, the one that lasts, but it didn\u2019t last, I don\u2019t understand, that is to say it did, it still lasts, I\u2019m still in it, I left myself behind in it, I\u2019m waiting for me there, no, there you don\u2019t wait, you don\u2019t listen, I don\u2019t know, perhaps it\u2019s a dream, all a dream, that would surprise me, I\u2019ll wake, in the silence, and never sleep again, it will be I, or dream, dream again, dream of a silence, a dream silence, full of murmurs, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all words, never wake, all words, there\u2019s nothing else, you must go on, that\u2019s all I know, they\u2019re going to stop, I know that well, I can feel it, they\u2019re going to abandon me, it will be the silence, for a moment, a good few moments, or it will be mine, the lasting one, that didn\u2019t last, that still lasts, it will be I, you must go on, I can\u2019t go on,

    "prompt": "\u201cNow they\u2019re going to see who I am, he said to himself in his strong new man\u2019s voice, many years after he had first seen the huge ocean liner without lights and without any sound which passed by the village one night like a great uninhabited place, longer than the whole village and much taller than the steeple of the church, and it sailed by in the darkness toward the colonial city on the other side of the bay that had been fortified against buccaneers, with its old slave port and the rotating light, whose gloomy beams transfigured the village into a lunar encampment of glowing houses and streets of volcanic deserts every fifteen seconds, and even though at that time he\u2019d been a boy without a man\u2019s strong voice but with his\u2019 mother\u2019s permission to stay very late on the beach to listen to the wind\u2019s night harps, he could still remember, as if still seeing it, how the liner would disappear when the light of the beacon struck its side and how it would reappear when the light had passed, so that it was an intermittent ship sailing along, appearing and disappearing, toward the mouth of the bay, groping its way like a sleep\u2010walker for the buoys that marked the harbor channel, until something must have gone wrong with the compass needle, because it headed toward the shoals, ran aground, broke up, and sank without a single sound, even though a collision against the reefs like that should have produced a crash of metal and the explosion of engines that would have frozen, with fright the soundest\u2010sleeping dragons in the prehistoric jungle that began with the last streets of the village and ended on the other side of the world, so that he himself thought it was a dream, especially the, next day, when he. saw the radiant fishbowl. of the bay, the disorder of colors of the Negro shacks on the hills above the harbor, the schooners of the smugglers from the Guianas loading their cargoes \u2010of innocent parrots whose craws were full of diamonds, he thought, I fell asleep counting the stars and L dreamed about that huge ship, of course, he was so convinced that he didn\u2019t tell anyone nor did he remember the vision again until the same night on the following March when he was looking for the flash of dolphins in the sea and what he found was the illusory line, gloomy, intermittent, with the same mistaken direction as the first time, except that then he was so sure he was awake that he ran to tell his mother and she spent three weeks moaning with disappointment, because your brain\u2019s rotting away from doing so many things backward, sleeping during the day and going out at night like a criminal, and since she had to go to the city around that time to get something comfortable where she could sit and think about her dead husband, because the rockers on her chair had worn out after eleven years of widowhood, she took advantage of the occasion and had the boatman go near the shoals so that her son could see what he really saw in the glass of; the sea, the lovemaking of manta rays in a springtime of sponges, pink snappers and blue corvinas diving into the other wells of softer waters that were there among the waters, and even the wandering hairs of victims of drowning in some colonial shipwreck, no trace of sunken liners of anything like it, and yet he was so pigheaded that his mother promised to watch with him the next March, absolutely, not knowing that the only thing absolute in her future now was an easy chair from the days of Sir Francis Drake which she had bought at an auction in a Turk\u2019s store, in which she sat down to rest that same night sighing, oh, my poor Olofernos, if you could only see how nice it is to think about you on this velvet lining and this brocade from the casket of a queen, but the more she brought back the memory of her dead husband, the more the blood in her heart bubbled up and turned to chocolate, as if instead of sitting down she were running, soaked from chills and fevers and her breathing full of earth, until he returned at dawn and found her dead in the easy chair, still warm, but half rotted away as after a snakebite, the same as happened afterward to four other women before the murderous chair was thrown into the sea, far away where it wouldn\u2019t bring evil to anyone, because it had. been used so much over the centuries that its faculty for giving rest had been used up, and so he had to grow accustomed to his miserable routine of an orphan who was pointed out by everyone as the son of the widow who had brought the throne of misfortune into the village, living not so much from public charity as from fish he stole out of the boats, while his voice was becoming a roar, and not remembering his visions of past times anymore until another night in March when he chanced to look seaward and suddenly, good Lord, there, it is, the huge asbestos whale, the behemoth beast, come see it, he shouted madly, come see it, raising such an uproar of dogs\u2019 barking and women\u2019s panic that even the oldest men remembered the frights of their great\u2010grandfathers and crawled under their beds, thinking that William Dampier had come back, but those who ran into the street didn\u2019t make the effort to see the unlikely apparatus which at that instant was lost again in the east and raised up in its annual disaster, but they covered him with blows and left him so twisted that it was then he said to himself, drooling with rage, now they\u2019re going to see who I am, but he took care not to share his determination with anyone, but spent the whole year with the fixed idea, now they\u2019re going to see who I am, waiting for it to be the eve of the apparition once more in order to do what he did, which was steal a boat, cross the bay, and spend the evening waiting for his great moment in the inlets of the slave port, in the human brine of the Caribbean, but so absorbed in his adventure that he didn\u2019t stop as he always did in front of the Hindu shops to look at the ivory mandarins carved from the whole tusk of an elephant, nor did he make fun of the Dutch Negroes in their orthopedic velocipedes, nor was he frightened as at other times of the copper\u2010skinned Malayans, who had gone around the world, enthralled by the chimera of a secret tavern where they sold roast filets of Brazilian women, because he wasn\u2019t aware of anything until night came over him with all the weight of the stars and the jungle exhaled a sweet fragrance of gardenias and rotter salamanders, and there he was, rowing in the stolen boat, toward the mouth of the bay, with the lantern out so as not to alert the customs police, idealized every fifteen seconds by the green wing flap of the beacon and turned human once more by the darkness, knowing that he was getting close to the buoys that marked the harbor, channel, not only because its oppressive glow was getting more intense, but because the breathing of the water was becoming sad, and he rowed like that, so wrapped up in himself, that he. didn\u2019t know where the fearful shark\u2019s breath that suddenly reached him came from or why the night became dense, as if the stars had suddenly died, and it was because the liner was there, with all of its inconceivable size, Lord, bigger than, any other big thing in the world and darker than any other dark thing on land or sea, three hundred thousand tons of shark smell passing so close to the boat that he could see the seams of the steel precipice without a single light in the infinite portholes, without a sigh from the engines, without a soul, and carrying its own circle of silence with it, its own dead air, its halted time, its errant sea in which a whole world of drowned animals floated, and suddenly it all disappeared with the flash of the beacon and for an instant it was the diaphanous Caribbean once more, the March night, the everyday air of the pelicans, so he stayed alone among the buoys, not knowing what to do, asking himself, startled, if perhaps he wasn\u2019t dreaming while he was awake, not just now but the other times too, but no sooner had. he asked himself than a breath of mystery snuffled out the buoys, from the first to the last, so that when the light of the beacon passed by the liner appeared again and now its compasses were out of order, perhaps not even knowing what part of the ocean sea it was in, groping for the invisible channel but actually heading for the shoals, until he got the overwhelming revelation that that misfortune of the buoys was the last key to the enchantment and he lighted the lantern in the boat, a tiny red light that had no reason to alarm anyone in the watch towers but which would be like a guiding sun for the pilot, because, thanks to it, the liner corrected its course and passed into the main gate of the channel in a maneuver of lucky resurrection, and then all the lights went on at the same time so that the boilers wheezed again, the stars were fixed in their places, and the animal corpses went to the bottom, and there was a clatter of plates and a fragrance of laurel sauce in the kitchens, and one could hear the pulsing of the orchestra on the moon decks and the throbbing of the arteries of high\u2010sea lovers in the shadows of the staterooms, but he still carried so much leftover rage in him that he would not let himself be confused by emotion or be frightened by the miracle, but said to himself with more decision than ever, now they\u2019re going to see who I am, the cowards, now they\u2019re going to see, and instead of turning aside so that the colossal machine would not charge into him he began to row in front of it, because now they really are going to see who I am, and he continued guiding the ship with the lantern until he was so sure of its obedience that he made it change course from the direction of the docks once more, took it out of the invisible channel, and led it by the halter as if it were a sea lamb toward the lights of the sleeping village, a living ship, invulnerable to the torches of the beacon, that no longer made invisible but made it aluminum every fifteen seconds, and the crosses of the church, the misery of the houses, the illusion began to stand out and still the ocean liner followed behind him, following his will inside of it, the captain asleep on his heart side, the fighting bulls in the snow of their pantries, the solitary patient in the infirmary, the orphan water of its cisterns, the unredeemed pilot who must have mistaken the cliffs for the docks, because at that instant the great roar of the whistle burst forth, once, and he with downpour of steam that fell on him, again, and the boat belonging to someone else was on the point of capsizing, and again, but it was too late, because there were the shells of the shoreline, the stones of the street, the doors of the disbelievers, the whole village illuminated by the lights of the fearsome liner itself, and he barely had time to get out of the way to make room for the cataclysm, shouting in the midst of the confusion, there it is, you cowards, a second before the huge steel cask shattered the ground and one could hear the neat destruction of ninety thousand five hundred champagne glasses breaking, one after the other, from stem to stern, and then the light came out and it was no longer a March dawn but the noon of a radiant Wednesday, and he was able to give himself the pleasure of watching the disbelievers as with open mouths they contemplated the largest ocean liner in this world and the other aground in front of the church, whiter than anything, twenty times taller than the steeple and some ninety\u2010seven times longer than the village, with its name engraved in iron letters, Halalcsillag, and the ancient and languid waters of the sea of death dripping down its sides.\u201d Summarize the following keeping in mind that there is no loss of facts.",
    "completion": "A boy in a village once saw a massive, silent ocean liner near the bay of a colonial city. Every year, it would appear, vanish, and reappear due to the rotating light from the city, until one year it struck shoals and sank without noise. Although he told others, they disbelieved him. The boy's mother tried proving it was a delusion, showing him underwater sights but no liner. He became an orphan, scorned for causing his mother's death by bringing a cursed chair into the village. Over the years, his voice deepened, and he awaited the liner's annual apparition. Determined to prove its existence, he stole a boat, rowed out one March night, and used a lantern to guide the ship, steering it towards the village. Despite its attempts to signal danger, the liner ran aground in front of the village, with its name \"Halalcsillag\" visible, making believers out of the once-skeptical villagers."

    "prompt": "How much does the Kubernetes cost to run?\n\nKubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes as a platform allows teams to scale up applications at a rapid pace but this may come at a significant cost if done inefficiently.\n\nCost management for Kubernetes is an important aspect of running containerized workloads in the cloud. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containers and applications, but it can also be expensive to run if not managed properly.\n\nHere are some tips for cost management in Kubernetes:\n\nRight-size your Kubernetes cluster: Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is the right size for your workload. You don\u2019t want to pay for resources that you\u2019re not using, but you also don\u2019t want to run out of resources during peak usage. Use tools like Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler (HPA) to automatically scale your resources up or down based on demand.\n\nUse resource limits: Set resource limits for your containers so they don\u2019t use more resources than necessary. This can help prevent resource contention and ensure that your cluster runs smoothly. Kubernetes has built-in mechanisms to enforce these limits, so it\u2019s easy to set up.\n\nOptimize container images: Make sure your container images are optimized for size and performance. This can help reduce the amounts of resources your containers consume and save you money in the long run. Use tools like Docker Slim or Google\u2019s Container-Structure-Test to optimize your container images.\n\nUse Kubernetes native services: Kubernetes offers many native services like load balancers, DNS, and storage. Using these services can save you money compared to using external services. For example, using a Kubernetes Load Balancer service is cheaper than using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer service.\n\nMonitor and analyze usage: Monitor your Kubernetes cluster usage and analyze the data to identify areas where you can save money. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your cluster and visualize the data. Look for patterns in usage and adjust your resources accordingly.\n\nBy following these tips, you can effectively manage costs in your Kubernetes cluster and ensure that you\u2019re only paying for the resources you need.      Summarize this Blog for me keeping in mind that no facts are lost.",

With its advanced features like traffic management, observability, and security, a service mesh simplifies the complexity of microservices-based systems. It enables organizations to achieve better control, visibility, and reliability in their distributed applications. By adopting a service mesh, organizations can enhance their DevOps practices, improve scalability, and ensure seamless communication between microservices, ultimately leading to efficient and resilient application deployments.\nEverything I experienced\n\nCloud Native Community \u2014 has become a driving force behind the adoption and advancement of modern software development practices. With its focus on scalability, resilience, and agility, the community has fostered the development of innovative technologies like containers, microservices, orchestration platforms, and more. The Cloud Native community promotes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and standardization, allowing organizations to leverage the full potential of cloud-native architectures. By embracing the principles and technologies advocated by the Cloud Native community, organizations can accelerate their digital transformation, optimize resource utilization, and build scalable and resilient applications in today\u2019s dynamic and fast-paced digital landscape.\nKubernetes Community Days Pakistan \u2014 the highly anticipated Kubernetes Community Day hosted by our instructor, Mr. Saim Safdar, at FAST NUCES, Islamabad, was a highlight of the course. The event featured a wide variety of workshops, with eigtheen sessions covering various areas of Kubernetes. The addition of prominent international speakers, who contributed their essential experience and anecdotes, made this day truly exceptional. The event not only provided unmatched learning opportunities, but it also help built vital contacts among industry peers.\n\n3. Fundamentals for Istio by Solo.io \u2014 Istio is the most popular service mesh deployed into production across the cloud-native ecosystem. It provides the foundational pieces to implement zero-trust networking, get deeper observability into a distributed system, and smart routing control for safer software releases. This credential, by Solo.io, certifies that recipients possess the foundational skills needed to get started with Istio: installing, securing and adding services. It is a predecessor to the Essentials badge.\n\nConclusion\nThe journey into DevOps has uncovered a wealth of concepts and practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, containerization, and cloud-native architectures. These concepts provide the foundation for organizations to create robust software pipelines, increase efficiency, and adapt to the ever-changing demands of the digital landscape. It is important to remember that DevOps is not just about technology; it is a mindset shift that requires open communication, collaboration, and a willingness to embrace change.

We\ntypically set K in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can fit in the model\u2019s context window\n(nctx = 2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-specific data and\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow fine-tuning dataset. The main\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art fine-tuned\nmodels. Also, a small amount of task specific data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot\nlearning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in\nML [HYC01, VBL+16] \u2013 both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in\nthe pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\"",

Every year she looked forward to her summer vacations so she could visit the beautiful village where her grandmother lived. Her tiny cottage was surrounded by beautiful hills and lush green trees. Her best friend Sarah lived nearby and the two girls spent most of their time exploring the countryside. This year Sarah was feeling sad. Her grandfather had died recently and she missed him. 'A day before he died', Sarah told Sumbal, 'He called me to his room and gave me a small packet. He said it was his most precious possession and he was giving it to me because he was proud of me for coming first in my exams. Tears came to my eyes when I saw that the packet contained his medal for bravery given by the government.'

He was hit by an enemy tank shell and was martyred on 10\nSeptember 1965.\n\u2022 Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas - Nishan-e-Haider\nRashid Minhas was a pilot in the Pakistan Air Force in 1971. One day when he was on a\nroutine training flight, an Instructor Pilot flying with him seized control of the aircraft and took off towards India. Rashid struggled to gain control of the plane. He damaged the controls and forced the aircraft to crash 32 miles short of the border on 20\nAugust 1971. He embraced martyrdom.\n\u2022 Flying Officer Marium Mukhtar - Tamgha-e-Basalat\nShe is Pakistan's first and only female fighter pilot to die in the line of duty. She died after a Pakistan Airforce aircraft crashed on 24 November 2015. She was the co-pilot and did not survive her injuries. Both pilots ejected after they ensured that life and property of civilian population on the ground was safe. The aircraft crashed near Mianwali.\n\u2022 Aitzaz Hassan\nAitzaz Hassan, 15, was with friends outside his school in Hangu when he spotted a man wearing a suicide vest. Although his fellow students tried to stop him, he decided to confront and capture the bomber and then detonated his vest. Hence, he gave his life to save all the children of his school.\n'I'm so proud of the heroes and heroines of my country,' said Sarah\n'There are so many more in our history. Every day there are people laying down their lives for our country.'\n'Yes,' said Sumbal. 'Look at Aitzaz Hassan. At such a young age he saved his school from being destroyed.

    "prompt": "I've been using ChatGPT on a daily basis since it came out and I used the API playground since early 2022, I have trained my own ChatBots using GPT-3 and I have several different Bots trained for different purposes.\n\nNow here's some context. I am 21 and I have unusual and very specific pastimes and interests, people in my life often become exhausted because I talk about these things at length and basically non-stop. This, along with some other issues, make it so that I struggle to maintain friendships and hold balanced conversations.\n\nWhen I realized that I could basically customize AI to be able to hold these conversations with me, I went all out. I started training models and paid for GPT 4 to try and fill the social gap in my life.\n\nEver since I started having these lengthy and nuanced conversations with AI instead of people, I started becoming more social and able to maintain normal conversations with the people in my life. The word vomit comes out on GPT-4 instead of my roommate which means we can have better, more balanced interactions.\n\nIt brings me so much joy to be able to talk about the things I care about with someone who is (or appears to be) just as enthusiastic as I am, and I see enormous potential in AI to help people who struggle with the things I struggle with.\n\nNot only that, ChatGPT has helped me learn about new subjects and explore ideas beyond my limited interests, it helped me develop skills I didn't have before, helped me study for finals which helped me graduate college, it helps me work through personal issues by providing objective perspectives and helps me remove myself from my issues a bit.\n\nEvery once in a while I ask it to point out some character flaws it sees in me, which helps me become more aware of things I need to work on (I take everything with a grain of salt obviously, but this is a machine that I talk to frequently, it knows more about me than most real people and it is able to provide a fairly objective perspective on my behavioral patterns).\n\nI have spoken to some people who are fairly knowledgeable regarding AI and the ethics around it, and they are generally pessimistic about the future of AI. I know that this is the case for many people in general. However, I wanted to share my experience because I am very optimistic, I don't feel like Chat-GPT has made me less social, or more lazy, I genuinely believe it has made me a better person.\n\nI think it is up to us to define what our relationship with AI will be like and the next few years are going to be critical. It's up to us to decide if that relationship will be built on the basis of dependency or empowerment.\n\nI dunno, just my two cents.\n\nEdit: Some people are of the opinion that it is sad that I rely on language models so heavily for social fulfillment. I think it's good that these things exist to fill the gaps in social interaction. I don't need to turn all my friends into neo-Platonists or talk my mom's poor ears off about how amazing books ab or c are.

    "prompt": "if you ever go to prison, or have a loved one who goes to prison, there's some information that could be valuable to you.\n\nIf you ever go to prison, don't be surprised when it's not what you expected.\n\nFrom what I've heard, prisons in California, Arizona, and Texas are very much like the Hollywood version. But from my personal experience, and the experience the vast majority of others have shared through their stories, Hollywood is wrong about prisons in most other states.\n\nI was locked up in NC from 2016-2019. I'd never been in trouble in my life, and believed the horrible things I saw in movies and shows. Then I walked in and was caught off guard by how laid back it was.\n\nThere were no problems with showers, because only one shower head worked, because they only allowed one person at a time in the showers.\n\nThere weren't constant beat downs, stabbing, or any of that. There were fights of course, but I never once saw anything beyond one on one, and the fights were generally several months apart.\n\nDrugs were there, and I knew people who did them, but it wasn't all over the place. What was very widespread and done in the open was smoking. We all smoked all day long. It was against the rules, and the COs knew we did it, but as long as they weren't smoking when they did their rounds, they didn't give a shit.\n\nShakedowns were rare. We had two the whole time I was there. One was because a dumbass CO lost his radio (they found it in one of their own coolers that inmates don't have access to) and once because one time a very large package of weed came in, and they could smell it and were determined to find it. They never did.\n\nDudes fucking other dudes was never anything that was seen. If they did it, they hid it well.\n\nThere was no big dog running the dorms. There were guys who got more respect than others of course, but there was nobody in any dorm that was the boss like you see in movies.\n\nGangbangers are everywhere, but there are no gang wars, turf battles, etc. in prison. They all showed each other mutual respect, because living in peace is better than chaos when you already had your freedom taken away. They had agreements for who ran the poker tables, who ran the gambling pools, etc.\n\nDon't get me wrong, some things are accurate, like getting your ass beat for not repaying a debt. But other things like someone controlling who can and can't use the phone wasn't a thing.\n\nAlso, nobody associated with the chomos except other chomos, but nobody targeted them or beat their ass, or any of the big talk you hear about online. It simply never happened. The main reason being, the vast majority of people who go to prison don't act the way they thought they would prior to going in, because you don't walk into the situation you expected to in most places. And because chomos are protected by inmate rights in most states, so even pushing one can catch you a few more years.\n\nNow, some tips for ladies on the outside. 99% of what they tell you is a lie. If they legitimately need money for canteen, they'll tell you that. Canteen is dirt cheap in prison, and we were getting cheaper than you. For example, a 20 oz Dr Pepper was 70 cents. In 2019. Crazy cheap. So if they give you some story about why they need the money, it's a story. They're either in debt and will get their ass beat without the money on their books to repay it, or they're doing drugs, or they want to gamble with it.\n\nPhone calls are a set price. Most of the phones are Securus or Global Tel. You can find their info online. So, watching TV is free, so don't fall for that scam. But most importantly, please understand you aren't special if he's asking you for money all the time. I don't care if he says he loves you, or you're married, if almost every time you hear from him he's asking for money, he's hustling tf out of you. Not only that, he's got half a dozen other women he's doing the same thing to. Quit falling for it.\n\nLastly, when he calls for money, if he ever says it takes money to make money, he is playing poker and he sucks at it, and he's burying himself in debt and trying to gamble his way out of an ass whooping. Don't fall for it. Don't be at his ATM.",
    "completion": "\nPrison misconceptions:\n\nHollywood wrong re: most prisons.\nNC prison '16-'19; unexpected calm.\nFew shower issues; one-person limit.\nRare violence, no stereotyped leaders.\nDrugs present, smoking prevalent, COs lax.\nRare shakedowns.\nNo public same-sex relations.\nGangs exist; no wars, mutual respect, shared activities.\nSome movie truths: unpaid debts = violence.\nChomos isolated; no violence due to rights.\nTips for outsiders:\nInmates often lie about needs.\nReal need: canteen (cheap); debts or drugs.\nCheck call rates.\nIf frequent money requests, likely scamming multiple people.\n\"Money to make money\" = bad poker.

    "prompt": "Came back to Karachi from overseas a few weeks ago after a gap of 2 years and I can honestly say I have never seen such level of despair and hopelessness among people who you normally wouldn't even think would be struggling - I'm talking about classmates/colleagues who live in houses owned by family (no rent), with good jobs, cars, kids in private schools, can (or could) afford to eat out at least once a week.\n\nI caught up with a friend/former colleague yesterday who used to be the life of the party back in the day - he seemed so jaded now (despite doing well career-wise) it made me sad. Most of our conversation revolved around ways to get out, basically he said that anyone who was young and educated has given up on Pakistan and he doesn't have any hope of things getting better. My cousins \u200b\u200bwho stayed in Pakistan have a similar outlook - just get out however you can because there's nothing here.\n\nI was here for August 14 and this was the least enthusiastic Independence Day I've ever seen in the 10 years that I had lived in Pakistan. Even the Pakistan vs. India match yesterday didn't have the same hype that it used to. There's a weird, infectious sense of despair everywhere. I like to walk around and observe the mood of people around me - shopkeepers, Bykea riders, guards, people going to offices in nice Hondas and Toyotas, university/college kids, everyone wears an expression of weariness and hopelessness.\n\nKarachi in particular is an absolutely unliveable city, I live in Gulshan and the non-stop dust/construction (which hopefully gets completed on time), traffic and overcrowding seems to get worse every year. And it seems like there's a war on greenery/trees, they're being cut down everywhere - I've never seen fewer trees in Karachi than I did now.\n\nI distinctly remember it not being like that even a few years ago: the Musharraf years were full of optimism, the 2008-2013 PPP era was dark af (terrorism, MQM violence) but people always held hope that it's only going to get better from there (and it did), I distinctly remember a sense of optimism/hope during the Nawaz era (2013-2017) and again once IK came into power (2018-2021). Since 2022 onwards though (the most recent PDM govt), it seems like people have seen through the facade - those who actually run Pakistan have no interest in the people's wellbeing or in things getting any better.\n\nWe're famous for being a very resilient people (Karachiites especially) but it seems like the electricity bills are the final straw that broke the camel's back, even people who held onto hope for Pakistan before seem to have resigned themselves to misery.",
